# Auditing reports in EOP

Auditing reports in Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP) can help you meet regulatory, compliance, and litigation requirements for your organization. You can obtain auditing reports at any time to determine the changes that have been made to your EOP configuration. These reports can help you troubleshoot configuration issues or find the cause of security-related or compliance-related problems.

## Auditing reports in EOP

There are two auditing reports available in EOP:
  
1. **Administrator role group report** The administrator role group report lets you view when a user is added to or removed from membership in an administrator role group. You can use this report to monitor changes to the administrative permissions assigned to users in your organization. For more information, see [Run an administrator role group report in EOP ](run-an-administrator-role-group-report-in-eop-eop.md).
    
2. **Administrator audit log** The administrator audit log records any action, based on an Exchange Management Shell cmdlet, performed by administrators or users who have been assigned administrative privileges. For more information, see [View the Administrator Audit Log](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/5c62072a-556d-4fea-9973-d668c6b9fd57.aspx).
