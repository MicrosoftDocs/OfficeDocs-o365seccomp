# SMTP Auth clients report

The **SMTP Auth clients** report highlights the use of the SMTP Auth client submission protocol by users or system accounts in your organization. This legacy protocol (which uses the endpoint smtp.office365.com) only offers Basic authentication, and is susceptible to being used by compromised accounts to send email.  This report allows you to check for unusual activity. It also shows the TLS usage data for clients or devices using SMTP Auth.

The widget that's shown in the Mail Flow dashboard indicates the number of users or service accounts that have used the SMTP Auth protocol in the last 7 days.

Clicking on the widget opens a flyout that provides an aggregated view of the TLS usage and volumes for the last week.

When you click on the **SMTP Auth Clients Report** link, you'll see two main data pivots and two data views. The data pivots are the **Sending Volume** and **TLS Usage**. The data views are the chart and the details table.

The **Sending Volume** view shows the number of messages that were sent using SMTP Auth for the specified time range. You can adjust the range by clicking **Filters**. The chart is organized by sender domain. You can see separate data for each domain by selecting the domain in the **Show data for** drop down.

You can view detailed information about the senders and their message counts by clicking **View details table**. To return to the chart, click **View report**.

The **TLS Usage** pivot is important due to the upcoming deprecation of TLS1.0 and TLS1.1 in Office 365. Many legacy devices and applications will be unable to send email if they are only capable of using TLS1.0 with SMTP Auth. This pivot allows you to identify and take action on users and system accounts that are still using older versions of TLS.

You can view detailed information about the senders, the versions of TLS they are using with SMTP Auth, and their message counts by clicking **View details table**. To return to the chart, click **View report**.

You can also download a more detailed version of the report by clicking Request report.
