# Data monitoring and reporting in Microsoft 365 security center

The **Data** category helps track user activity that could lead to unauthorized data disclosure. These are the rework of existing Office 365 DLP policy reports plus a third-party DLP policy match report.

You can see:

* Users who share the most files from cloud apps
* How many DLP policy matches occurred
* How many DLP policies overrides or false positives are reported
* How many DLP policy matches happened in 3rd party cloud services via Microsoft Cloud App Security
