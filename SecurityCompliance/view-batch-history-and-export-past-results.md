# View batch history and export past results in Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery

> [!NOTE]
> Advanced eDiscovery requires an Office 365 E3 with the Advanced Compliance add-on or an E5 subscription for your organization. If you don't have that plan and want to try Advanced eDiscovery, you can [sign up for a trial of Office 365 Enterprise E5](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=698279). 
  
The following section describes additional options for batch viewing and export of data in Advanced eDiscovery. 
  
## Viewing Export batch history and exporting previous batches

The Export history dialog provides detailed information of selected export batch sessions and also provides the ability to undo the last session.
  
1. In **Export \> Setup**, select the batch name from the **Export batch** drop-down list. 
    
2. To the right of the export batch name, select the **Batch history** icon:
