# Walkthrough - From an insight to a detailed report

If you're new to [reports and insights in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](reports-and-insights-in-security-and-compliance.md), it might help to see how you can easily navigate from an insight to a detailed report. 
  
This is one of several walkthroughs for the [Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com). To see additional walkthroughs, see the [Related topics](#related-topics) section. 
  
## From an insight to a detailed report

Let's walk through the flow from the dashboard to an insight to a detailed report for data exploration. (This is a brief [data loss prevention](data-loss-prevention-policies.md) example.) 
  
1. We begin with a dashboard in the [Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com). (Go to **Reports** \> **Dashboard**.)<br/>![In the Security &amp; Compliance Center, choose Reports \> Dashboard](media/2a668c3d-3fa3-4e37-8149-46989b33ae8c.png)
  
2. In the upper left corner of the dashboard, next to **Top insights &amp; recommendations**, we have a link. (Click **View all**.)<br/>![In the Security &amp; Compliance Center, choose Reports \> Dashboard to see your top insights](media/9bb64e11-494f-40a4-ab3d-8d3c7789f300.png)<br/>This takes us to a list of insights for our organization.<br/>![In the Security &amp; Compliance Center, you can view all insights in a list](media/1289af77-bf5a-444a-97a1-03d8a83f75a9.png)
  
3. Selecting an item in the list opens a pane where we can view more details about that item. (Click an item.)<br/>![Details for a selected insight](media/dcbb389f-23b0-4031-b789-4a49068af85a.png)<br/>We see recommended actions we should consider, such as reviewing policies. ([Learn more about data loss prevention policies](data-loss-prevention-policies.md).)
    
4. We also have a link to view more details. (Click **See related activity in Explorer**.)<br/>This takes us to a report type called [Threat Explorer (and real-time detections)](threat-explorer.md), where we can apply filters and drill into specific details.<br/>![Explorer view with more detail about a selected insight](media/3ad15b15-7158-44b7-beda-013351bd868e.png)
  
In this way, we can move easily from an insight into its underlying details, and make more informed decisions about data loss prevention for an organization.
