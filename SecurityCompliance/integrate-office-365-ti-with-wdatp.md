# Integrate Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection with Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection

If you are part of your organization's security team, you can integrate [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection](office-365-atp.md) and related investigation and response features with [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection). This can help you quickly understand if users' machines are at risk when you are investigating threats in Office 365. For example, once integration is enabled, you will be able to see a list of machines that are used by the recipients of a detected email message, as well as how many recent alerts those machines have in Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection.
  
The following image shows the **Devices** tab that you'll see when have Microsoft Defender ATP integration enabled:

In this example, you can see that the recipients of the email message have four devices and one has an alert. Clicking the link for a device opens its page in the Microsoft Defender Security Center.
  
## Requirements

- Your organization must have Office 365 ATP Plan 2 (or Office 365 E5) and Microsoft Defender ATP.
    
- You must be an Office 365 Global Administrator or have a security administrator role (such as Security Administrator) assigned in the [Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com). (See [Permissions in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md))
    
- You must have access to both [Explorer (or real-time detections)](threat-explorer.md) in the Security & Compliance Center and the Microsoft Defender Security Center.
