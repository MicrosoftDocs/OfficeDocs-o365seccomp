# Report junk email messages to Microsoft

The Microsoft Junk Email Reporting Add-in for Microsoft Office Outlook offers several ways for you to report junk email messages:
  
- From the Outlook ribbon
    
- From your Inbox
    
- From within an opened email message
    
The Junk Email Reporting Add-in helps you submit reports to the Microsoft Exchange Online Protection (EOP) service. If your mailbox is not protected by the service, your junk email report submission will not affect your spam filters. Administrators can learn about more spam settings that apply to a whole organization at [How to help ensure that a message isn't marked as spam](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=534224) or [Block email spam with the Office 365 spam filter to prevent false negative issues](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=534225). These are helpful if you have administrator-level control and you want to prevent false positives or false negatives.
  
> [!TIP]
> You can also submit spam messages directly to Microsoft by using the [junk@office365.microsoft.com](mailto:junk@office365.microsoft.com) email address, and false positive (non-spam) messages by using the [not_junk@office365.microsoft.com](mailto: not_junk@office365.microsoft.com) email address. For more information, see [Submit spam, non-spam, and phishing scam messages to Microsoft for analysis](submit-spam-non-spam-and-phishing-scam-messages-to-microsoft-for-analysis.md).
