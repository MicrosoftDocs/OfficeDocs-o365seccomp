# Set up and download a custom report in the Security &amp; Compliance Center

In the [Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), several [reports and insights](reports-and-insights-in-security-and-compliance.md) are available to help your organization's security team mitigate and address threats to your organization. If you're a member of your organization's security team, you can configure a report with custom date ranges and filters, and then download your custom report. 
  
## Download a custom report

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you have the necessary [permissions for the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](permissions-in-the-security-and-compliance-center.md). In general, Office 365 global administrators, security administrators, and security readers can access reports in the Security &amp; Compliance Center. 
  
1. In the [Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), go to **Reports** \> **Dashboard**.
