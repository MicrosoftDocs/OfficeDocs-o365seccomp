# Search the audit log for user and admin activity in Office 365

The Office 365 audit log is a unified audit log. Why a unified audit log? Because events from most Office 365 services that you're organization subscribes to are recorded in a single audit log that you can search. That means you can search for user and admin activity in these services: 
  
- SharePoint
- OneDrive
- Exchange
- Azure Active Directory
- Microsoft Teams
- eDiscovery
- Power BI
- Yammer
- Sway
- Microsoft Stream
   
 ## Set up auditing
  
There's few things you have to do before you can search the Office 365 audit log.
  
- [Turn on audit log search](turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off.md) to start recording events that you can search for 
    
- [Enable mailbox auditing](enable-mailbox-auditing.md) so you can search for mailbox-related events; such as when a user signs in to their mailbox or purges items from their Recoverable Items folder 
    
 ## Search the audit log
  
After you turn on auditing, you search for hundreds of individual types of events from multiple Office 365 services.
  
- [Search the audit log](search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance.md) for user and admin activities 
    
- [Understand the detailed properties](detailed-properties-in-the-office-365-audit-log.md) in each auditing record included in the search results 
    
- [Search for eDiscovery-related activities](search-for-ediscovery-activities-in-the-audit-log.md) performed by admins and compliance managers
