# How ffice 365 ATP Safe Attachments works

## How it works

The ATP Safe Attachments feature checks email attachments for people in your organization. When an ATP Safe Attachments policy is in place and someone covered by that policy views their email in Office 365, their email attachments are checked and appropriate actions are taken, based on your ATP Safe Attachments policies. Depending on how your policies are defined, people can continue working without ever knowing they were sent malicious files.
  
Here are two examples of ATP Safe Attachments at work.
  
- **Example 1: Email attachment** Suppose that Lee receives an email message that has an attachment. It is not obvious to Lee whether that attachment is safe or actually contains malware designed to steal Lee's user credentials. In Lee's organization, a security administrator defined an ATP Safe Attachments policy a few days ago. With the ATP Safe Attachments feature, the email attachment is opened and tested in a virtual environment before Lee receives it. If the attachment is determined to be malicious, it will be removed automatically. If the attachment is safe, it will open as expected when Lee clicks on it.

- **Example 2: File in SharePoint Online** Suppose that Jean received a file and uploaded it into a library in SharePoint Online. Jean shares the link to the file with the rest of the team, not knowing that the file is actually malicious. Fortunately, [ATP for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft Teams](atp-for-spo-odb-and-teams.md) detects the malicious file and blocks it. A few days later, Chris goes to open the document. Although Chris can see the file is there, Chris cannot open or share it, which protects Chris's computer and others from the malicious file.

ATP Safe Attachments policies can be applied to specific people or groups in your organization, or to your entire domain. In addition, ATP Safe Attachments policies can be configured to use placeholder attachments while actual attachments are being scanned. To learn more, see **[Set up ATP Safe Attachments policies in Office 365](set-up-atp-safe-attachments-policies.md)**.

> [!NOTE]
> ATP Safe Attachments scanning takes place in the same region where your Office 365 data resides. For more information about data center geography, see [Where is your data located?](https://products.office.com/where-is-your-data-located?geo=All)
