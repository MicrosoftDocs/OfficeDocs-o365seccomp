# Troubleshooting and support information

This topic describes troubleshooting steps for end users and administrators, and provides information about how to contact technical support for assistance.
  
## Troubleshooting for Users

Occasionally, you may experience trouble with Microsoft Office Outlook after adding the Junk Email Reporting Add-In. Following are problems that you may encounter, along with tips for resolving these issues. 
  
- Nothing happens when you click **Report Junk**
    
- Outlook stops responding after you select an email message
    
- Reported junk mail cannot be delivered due to an "undeliverable" reply
    
### Troubleshooting tip

1. Close and restart Microsoft Office Outlook.
    
2. Verify that you are able to create and send a test message. To do this, you can send a test message to another email account that you are responsible for, and then verify that the email message is received.
    
If the problem persists, contact your IT administrator.
  
> [!TIP]
> You can also submit spam messages directly to Microsoft by using the [junk@office365.microsoft.com](mailto:junk@office365.microsoft.com) email address, and false positive messages by using the [not_junk@office365.microsoft.com](mailto: not_junk@office365.microsoft.com) email address. For more information, see [Submit spam, non-spam, and phishing scam messages to Microsoft for analysis](submit-spam-non-spam-and-phishing-scam-messages-to-microsoft-for-analysis.md). 
  
## Troubleshooting for Administrators

As an administrator, you might experience issues with users using the Junk Email Reporting Add-in for Microsoft Office Outlook. Following are some tips for resolving problems that you might encounter. 
  
 **Problem:** An error message asking users to contact their system administrator continually appears. 
  
### Troubleshooting tip

1. Set the following registry key value to "Verbose":
    
  - **32 bit Outlook installed on a 32 bit operating system:**
    
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Junk Email Reporting\Addins\LoggingLevel
    
  - **32 bit Outlook installed on a 64 bit operating system:**
    
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Junk Email Reporting\Addins\LoggingLevel
    
  - **64 bit Outlook (always installed on a 64 bit operating system):**
    
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Junk Email Reporting\Addins\LoggingLevel
    
2. Restart Microsoft Office Outlook and ask users to report back when they see the error message.
    
3. Collect the log information found at the following location: 
    
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Junk Email Reporting Add-in\SpamReporterAddinLog.txt
    
4. Contact Exchange Online Protection Technical Support and provide them with the log information. 
    
 **Problem:** Users choose not to receive a confirmation when they submit an email as junk and now they want the option back. 
  
### Troubleshooting tip

1. Set the following registry key value to "True": HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Junk E-mail Reporting\Preferences\ConfirmReportJunk
    
2. Restart Microsoft Office Outlook.
