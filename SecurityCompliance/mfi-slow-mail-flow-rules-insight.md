# Slow mail flow rules insight

Inefficient mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) can lead to mail flow delays for your organization. This insight reports mail flow rules that have an impact on your organization's mail flow. Examples of these types of rules are:

- Conditions that use **Is member of** for large groups.

- Conditions that use complex regular expression (regex) pattern matching.

- Conditions that use content checking in attachments.

The insight will help you to identify and fine-tune mail flow rules to help reduce mail flow delays.
