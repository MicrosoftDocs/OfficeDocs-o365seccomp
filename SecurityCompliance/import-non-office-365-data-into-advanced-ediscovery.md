# Import non-Office 365 content for Advanced eDiscovery analysis

Not all documents that you may need to analyze with Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery will live in Office 365. With the Non-Office 365 content import feature in Advanced eDiscovery you can upload documents that don't live in Office 365 (except PST files) into a case linked, Azure storage blob and analyze them with Advanced eDiscovery. This procedure shows you how to bring your non-Office 365 documents into Advanced eDiscovery for analysis.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Advanced eDiscovery requires an Office 365 E3 with the Advanced Compliance add-on or an E5 subscription for your organization. If you don't have that plan and want to try Advanced eDiscovery, you can [sign up for a trial of Office 365 Enterprise E5](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=698279). 
  
> [!NOTE]
> You can purchase an Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery data storage add-on subscription for your non-Office 365 content. This is exclusively available for content that is to be analyzed with Advanced eDiscovery. Follow the steps in [Buy or edit and add-on for Office 365 for business](https://support.office.com/article/Buy-or-edit-an-add-on-for-Office-365-for-business-4e7b57d6-b93b-457d-aecd-0ea58bff07a6) and purchase the Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery storage add-on. 
  
## Before you begin

Using the upload Non-Office 365 feature as described in this procedure requires that you have:
  
- An Office 365 E3 with Advanced Compliance add-on or E5 subscription
    
- All custodians whose non-Office 365 content will be uploaded must have E3 with Advanced Compliance add-on or E5 licenses
    
- An existing eDiscovery case
    
- All the files for uploading gathered into folders where there is one folder per custodian and the folders' name is in this format  *alias@domainname*  . The  *alias@domainname*  must be users Office 365 alias and domain. You can collect all the  *alias@domainname*  folders into a root folder. The root folder can only contain the  *alias@domainname*  folders, there must be no loose files in the root folder 
    
- An account that is either an eDiscovery Manager or eDiscovery Administrator
    
- [Microsoft Azure Storage Tools](https://aka.ms/downloadazcopy) installed on a computer that has access to the non-Office 365 content folder structure. 
    
## Upload non-Office 365 content into Advanced eDiscovery

1. As an eDiscovery Manager or eDiscovery Administrator, open **eDiscovery**, and open the case that the non-Office 365 data will be uploaded to. If you need to create a case, see [Manage eDiscovery cases in the Office 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center](manage-ediscovery-cases.md)
    
2. Click **Switch to Advanced eDiscovery**
    
3. Under **Source type** select **Non-Office 365 data**.
    
4. Click **Add container**. Name the container and add a description.
    
5. Select the newly added container from the container list and copy the URL that appears in the container details pane and then close the pane
    
6. Open a command prompt as an administrator and change directory to folder where you have AzCopy installed..
    
7. Construct the AzCopy command line to upload the files like this:
    
    AzCopy /Source:" *full path to root folder on local machine*  " /Dest:"  *container URL up to but not including the ?*  " /DestSAS:"  *remainder of the container url from the ? to the end*  " /S. 
    
    For example, using these values: 
    
  - root folder - C:\Collected Data 
    
  - container url - https://zoomsabcprodeuss114.blob.core.windows.net/ingestion53d059efe5f74784afb308f66cdebf17?sv=2015-04-05&amp;sr=c&amp;si=NonOfficeData15%7C0&amp;sig=Bk5INP8CUfv1y4CSJiJl3pJt3Ekvu8GS3P8NkOvoQxA%3D
    
    the AzCopy command line syntax would be:
    
     `AzCopy /Source:"C:\CollectedData" /Dest:"https://zoomsabcprodeuss114.blob.core.windows.net/ingestion53d059efe5f74784afb308f66cdebf17" /DestSAS:"?sv=2015-04-05&amp;sr=c&amp;si=NonOfficeData15%7C0&amp;sig=Bk5INP8CUfv1y4CSJiJl3pJt3Ekvu8GS3P8NkOvoQxA%3D" /S`
    
    For more information on Azcopy syntax see, [Transfer data with the AzCopy on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy) . 
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > There must be one root folder per user and the folder name must be in the  *alias@domainname*  format. 
  
8. Once the folders have finished uploading, switch back to Advanced eDiscovery. The content in the folders you uploaded is now ready to be processed in Advanced eDiscovery. Select the container and click the Process button. For more details on Advanced eDiscovery Processing see, [Run the Process module and load data in Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery](run-the-process-module-and-load-data-in-advanced-ediscovery.md)
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Once the container is successfully processed in Advanced eDiscovery, you will no longer be able to add new content to the SAS storage in Azure. If you collect additional content and you want to add it to the case for Advanced eDiscovery analysis, you must create a new **Non-Office 365 data** container and repeat this procedure. 
  
    > [!NOTE]
    > If the container  *does not process successfully due to folder naming issues*  and you then fix the issues, you will still have to create a new container and the reconnect and upload again using the procedures in this article.
