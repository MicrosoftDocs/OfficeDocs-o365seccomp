# Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Workshop Training

The Chief Information Security Office (CISO) workshop contains a collection of security learnings, principles, and recommendations for modernizing security in your organization. This training workshop is a combination of experiences from Microsoft’s security teams and learnings from our customers.

The CISO workshop can help your organization meet the dual security challenges of:

- Increasingly sophisticated attacks
- Protecting assets on a hybrid enterprise that now includes cloud platforms

The CISO workshop videos and PDF/PowerPoint download content are designed to be modular so you can jump to any section of interest or start at the beginning. The slides for each module are shared with a creative commons (with attribution) license to help your organization build effective security strategies.
