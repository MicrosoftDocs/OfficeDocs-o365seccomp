# Use user spam notifications to release and report quarantined messages in Office 365

If your admin enables spam notifications for users, you'll receive a notification message that lists messages addressed to your mailbox that were identified as spam and quarantined instead.
  
> [!TIP]
> If you're an administrator and want to enable this feature, you can choose the option when you [modify a default anti-spam policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=800313). 
  
The message you receive includes the number of spam-quarantined messages you have, and the date and time (in Universal Coordinated Time or UTC) of the last message in the list. The list includes the following for each message:
  
- **Sender** The send name and email address of the quarantined message. 
    
- **Subject** The subject line text of the quarantined message. 
    
- **Date** The date and time (in UTC) that the message was quarantined. 
    
- **Size** The size of the message, in kilobytes (KBs). 
    
These are the actions that you can take with a quarantined message:

- **Preview** the message if you would like to preview the content or header prior to taking action.

- **Download** the message if you would like to review the message and attachments (if any) on your device prior to taking action.

- **Release** if the message isn’t spam and you want Office 365 to send the message to your mailbox.

- **Release & Allow Sender** if the message isn’t spam and you want Office 365 to add the sender to your safe senders and recipients list for future emails. Keep in mind that your admin may have other organization wide allow/block configurations that override your safe sender list.

- **Release & Report**, if the message isn’t spam and you want to send the message to your mailbox and report it to Microsoft for analysis.

- **Block** if you want Office 365 to add the sender to your blocked senders list.

Be aware of the following:
  
- Messages that are quarantined because they matched a mail flow rule are not included in user quarantined messages. Only spam-quarantined messages are listed.
    
- You can only release a message and report it as a false positive (not junk) once.
