|[Manage advanced alerts ](https://docs.microsoft.com/cloud-app-security/what-is-cloud-app-security) <br/> |Use the **Manage advanced alerts** feature of Office 365 Cloud App Security to set up policies that can alert you to suspicious and anomalous activity in Office 365. After you're alerted, you can investigate situations that are potentially problematic and, if needed, take action to address security issues.  <br/> |
