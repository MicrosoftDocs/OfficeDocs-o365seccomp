# View email security reports in the Security &amp; Compliance Center

A variety of reports are available in the [Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com) to help you see how email security features, such as anti-spam, anti-malware, and encryption features in Office 365 are protecting your organization. If you have the [necessary permissions](#what-permissions-are-needed-to-view-these-reports), you can view these reports in the Security &amp; Compliance Center by going to **Reports** \> **Dashboard**.
  
![Dashboard where you see how Advanced Threat Protection is working](media/6b213d34-adbb-44af-8549-be9a7e2db087.png)
  
Your email security reports include the following:
- [Encryption report](#encryption-report) (NEW!)
- [Threat Protection Status report](#threat-protection-status-report) 
- [Malware Detections report](#malware-detections-report) 
- [Top Malware report](#top-malware-report)
- [Top Senders and Recipients report](#top-senders-and-recipients-report)
- [Spoof Detections report](#spoof-detections-report)
- [Spam Detections report](#spam-detections-report)
- [Sent and received email report](#sent-and-received-email-report)
- [User-reported messages report](#user-reported-messages-report)
    
## Encryption report

(**NEW!**) The **Encryption report** shows information about email messages that were encrypted, either through your organization's policies, or through end-user controls. Your organization's security team can use information in this report to identify patterns and proactively apply or adjust policies for sensitive email messages.

To view this report, in the Security & Compliance Center, go to **Reports** \> **Dashboard** \> **Encryption report**.

![Encryption report](media/encryptionreport-defaultview.png) 

When the report first opens, you'll see data about encryption methods used on email messages for the past seven (7) days. You can change the date range and the details that are displayed in the report by clicking **Filters** in the upper right corner of the screen.

![Encryption report filters](media/encryptionreport-filters.png)   

You can also use the **Break down by** menu to view data by encryption template (or method).

![Encryption method or template](media/encryptionreport-breakdownby.png)

And, you can use the **View data by** menu to change the view to see counts of encrypted messages to the top five recipient domains.

![Encryption report view data by menu](media/encryptionreport-viewdataby.png)

With the flexibility of the new Encryption report, you can view trends and take appropriate actions. For example, if you see a high number of email messages encrypted by users, you might want to add an encryption policy to automate encryption for certain use cases. (To get help with that, see [Define mail flow rules to encrypt email messages in Office 365](define-mail-flow-rules-to-encrypt-email.md).) As another example, if you have a number of encryption templates available but no one is using them, you might explore whether users need training for that feature. 

Use this report enables your organization's security and compliance team to monitor how message encryption is being used, and whether further actions are needed. To learn more about encryption, see [Email encryption in Office 365](email-encryption.md).

## Threat Protection Status report

The **Threat Protection Status** report is a smart report that shows malicious email that was detected and blocked by Exchange Online Protection. This report is useful for viewing email identified as malware or a phishing attempt over time (up to 90 days), and it enables security administrators to identify trends or determine whether policies need adjustments.

> [!NOTE]
> A Threat Protection Status report is available to customers who have either [Office 365 ATP](office-365-atp.md) or [Exchange Online Protection](eop/exchange-online-protection-eop.md) (EOP); however, the information that is displayed in the Threat Protection Status report for ATP customers will likely contain different data than what EOP customers might see. For example, EOP customers can view information about malware detected in email, but not information about [malicious files detected in SharePoint Online, OneDrive, or Microsoft Teams](atp-for-spo-odb-and-teams.md), an ATP-specific capability. ([Learn more about ATP reports](view-reports-for-atp.md).)
  
To view this report, in the [Security &amp; Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com), go to **Reports** \> **Dashboard** \> **Threat Protection Status**.
  
![Threat Protection Status report](media/0ff86e12-c2b2-4d89-92a5-cefb054dc070.png)
  
When you first open the Threat Protection Status report, the report shows data for the past seven days by default; however, you can click **Filters** and change the date range for up to 90 days of detail. (If you are using a trial subscription, you might be limited to 30 days' of data.)

This report is useful for viewing the effectiveness and impact of your organization's [Exchange Online Protection features](eop/eop-features.md), and for longer-term trending. 
  
![Threat Protection Status report filters](media/ab6b6b8d-e97a-4c3a-8fb1-c4940dcb7a07.png)
  
You can also choose whether to view data for email identified as malicious, email identified as a phishing attempts, or email identified as containing malware.
