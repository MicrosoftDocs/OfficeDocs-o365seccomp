# Query the data in evidence

In most cases, it will be useful to be able to dig deeper into what is there in a evidence and organize them to review more efficiently. Queries within a evidence enables you to do so by letting you focus on a subset of documents that meet the criteria defined by you at once.

## Creating and running a query within a evidence

In order to create and run a query within your evidence, click on "New Query" in your evidence. After you name your query and define the conditions, click "Save" to run the query. To run a query that has been previously saved, simply click on the saved query.

## Conditions

You can use a number of conditions to define your queries. They range from metadata such as sent date and participants to analytics results, such as inclusive types and dominant themes. You must first analyze your evidence before using analytics results as conditions. The conditions can be OR'ed or AND'ed; in order to mix connectors, you can use condition groups.

## Filters
Filters act as querying within a query; You can overly filter conditions on your search condition.
