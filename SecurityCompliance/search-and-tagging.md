# Search and Tagging

In Advanced eDiscovery, the Search and Tagging module enables you to search, preview, and organize the documents in your case. Currently, this module is in beta. For a brief demonstration of searching and tagging, see the [Manage your data with Advanced eDiscovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaPYL3DHP6I) video.

> [!NOTE]
> Advanced eDiscovery requires an Office 365 E3 with the Advanced Compliance add-on or an E5 subscription for your organization. If you don't have that plan and want to try Advanced eDiscovery, you can [sign up for a trial of Office 365 Enterprise E5](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=698279). 
  
## Search the documents in your case

After you have processed documents in an Advanced eDiscovery case (and optionally run the Analyze or Relevance module), you can use the Search and Tagging to search documents and then organize them by applying case-specific tags (also called labels). You can define a search query using the provided condition cards or by using a KQL-like query language in the Keywords condition card. Common KQL syntax, such as AND, OR, NOT, and NEAR(n) are supported, as well as trailing multi-character wildcard (*). 

The following table lists the properties that you can search for using a KQL keyword query. Alternatively, you can use a condition card for in the Advanced eDiscovery Search tool to add a condition (for selected properties) to a search query.

|**Property**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**caselabel** <br/> | The name of the tag created/applied when a document is tagged. <br/> |
|**custodian** <br/> | The custodian associated with a document; subject to limitations. <br/> |

|**participants** <br/> | The email address of all participants in an email thread, including for missing links. <br/> |

\* Only available if the Themes module has been run.

\*\* Only available if the Relevance module has been run.

Alternatively, you can use a condition card in the Advanced eDiscovery Search tool to add a condition (for selected properties) to a search query. The following screenshot shows the conditions that can be added to a query. The **Group** column indicates whether the property applies to email, site documents, or both (indicated by the value *Common*). This column also identifies the searchable properties that are available after you run the Relevance module.
