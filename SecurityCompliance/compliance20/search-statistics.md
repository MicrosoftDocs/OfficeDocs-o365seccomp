# Search statistics

One way you can validate your search results is to look at the statistics around your results to make sure they align with your expectations. When a search completes, high-level statistics are shown on the search details flyout:
- Number and volume of items retrieved by the search
- Number and volume of partially indexed/unindexed items that were found in the search locations
- Number of mailboxes and locations searched.
In order to view more detailed statistics, click on "Statistics" from the search details flyout.

## Summary

In Summary view, you can see the search results broken down by location type (e.g. Exchange). For each location type, you can see:
- Number of locations that had items that matched the search conditions
- Number of items from these locations that matched the search conditions
- Total volume of items that matched the search conditions.

## Top locations

In Top locations view, you see the individual locations with the most matches. For each location, you will see:
- Location name (e.g. SharePoint URL)
- Location type
- Number of items that matched the search conditions
- Total volume of items that matched the search conditions.

## Queries

If you have used (c:s) keyword or keyword rows in your query, then you can see the breakdown of your query in Queries view per location type. For each location type, you will see:

- Part: this column will either have the word "Primary" or "Keyword". "Primary" means that the row presents statistics on the entire query, whereas "Keyword" means one of the query components.

- Query: the actual query component the row refers to. If Part is "Primary", this will be the entire query; if Part was "Keyword", you will see one of the query components here.
  
  - When you search all contentin mailboxes (by not specifying any keywords), the actual query is (size >= 0) so that all items are returned
  
  - When you search SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business sites, the two following components are added:
    
    - NOT IsExternalContent:1 - excludes any content from an on-premises SharePoint organization
    
    - NOT isOneNotePage: 1 - excludes all OneNote files because these would be duplicates of any document that matches the search query.

- Number of locations that had items that matched the search conditions.

- Number of items from these locations that matched the search conditions.

- Total volume of items that matched the search conditions.
