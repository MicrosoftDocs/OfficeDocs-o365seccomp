# Work with processing errors in Advanced eDiscovery

Processing is the process of file identification, expansion of embedded documents and attachments, text extraction, OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of image files and indexing of that content.  

When a custodian is added to the case from the **Custodians** tab, all partially indexed items from Office 365 are processed to make them fully searchable.  Likewise, when content is added to a review set from Office 365 data sources or non-Office 365 data sources, the content is also processed.

The **Processing** tab in Advanced eDiscovery provides transparency into the status of *Advanced Indexing* for all of these scenarios.

See the following articles for more details.

- [Advanced indexing of custodian data](indexing-custodian-data.md)
- [Error remediation when processing data](error-remediation.md)
