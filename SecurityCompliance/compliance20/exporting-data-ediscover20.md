# Export case data in Advanced eDiscovery

There are three ways to export data from a review set:

**Download** – Use to download (by using a browser) a small set of native files. This is the quickest was to export a small set of data.

**Export** – Use to customize what data is exported, including the export of metadata files, native files, text files, and redacted documents that have been saved to a PDF file. After exported data is uploaded Azure storage location, you have to download it to a local computer. For more information, see: 

   - [Export documents from a review set](export-documents-from-review-set.md)

**Add to another review set** – Use to copy data from one review set to a different review set. For more information, see [Add data from one review set to another review set](add-data-to-review-set-from-another-review-set.md).
