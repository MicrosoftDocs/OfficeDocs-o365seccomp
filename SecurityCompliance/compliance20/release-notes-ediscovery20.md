# Release notes for Advanced eDiscovery

The Public Preview program for Advanced eDiscovery is the way to get early access to the upcoming functionality and updates. To get early access to the newest features, just create and use an Advanced eDiscovery case in the Security & Compliance Center. See [Create a new case](create-new-ediscovery-case.md).

## Known issues

**Microsoft Forms**

- The data corresponding to a form created before January 31, 2019 will not be searchable when using the Search tool in Advanced eDiscovery to search custodian mailboxes. Forms created after this date will be available to search.

- A form created by a user can still receive responses even after the user who created the Form is deleted. However, the corresponding data for those responses (that occurred after the custodian mailbox was deleted) will not be searchable when using the Search tool in Advanced eDiscovery to search custodian mailboxes.
 
**Microsoft Sway**

- If a user edits a sway just prior to the deletion of the user account for the owner of that sway, then those changes may not be be searchable when using the Search tool in Advanced eDiscovery to search custodian mailboxes. Sway blocks changes to to a sway as soon as it receives a signal that the account was deleted. However, there's a small chance that a sway can be edited before this signal is received.
