# Build search queries

In building your query, you can use various keywords and conditions to define which items to find.

## Keyword searches

Type a search query in **Keywords** box. You can specify keywords, message properties such as sent and received dates, or document properties such as file names or the date that a document was last changed. You can use a more complex queries that use a Boolean operator, such as **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, and **NEAR**. You can also search for sensitive information (such as social security numbers) in documents, or search for documents that have been shared externally. If you leave the keyword box empty, all content located in the specified content locations will be included in the search results.
    
Alternatively, you can click the **Show keyword list** checkbox and the type a keyword in each row. If you do this, the keywords on each row are connected by a logical operator ( **c:s**) that is similar in functionality to the **OR** operator in the search query that's created. 
    
Why use the keyword list? You can get statistics that show how many items match each keyword. This can help you quickly identify which keywords are the most (and least) effective. You can also use a keyword phrase (surrounded by parentheses) in a row. For more information about search statistics, see [Search statistic](search-statistics.md).

## Conditions
    
You can add search conditions to narrow a search and return a more refined set of results. Each condition adds a clause to the search query that is created and run when you start the search. A condition is logically connected to the keyword query (specified in the keyword box) by a logical operator (**c:c**) that is similar in functionality to the **AND** operator. That means that items have to satisfy both the keyword query and one or more conditions to be included in the results. This is how conditions help to narrow your results. For a list and description of conditions that you can use in a search query, see the "Search conditions" section in [Keyword queries and search conditions for Content Search](../keyword-queries-and-search-conditions.md#search-conditions).
