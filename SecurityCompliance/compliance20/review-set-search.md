# Query the data in a review set

In most cases, it will be useful to be able to dig deeper into what is there in a review set and organize them to review more efficiently. Queries within a review set enables you to do so by letting you focus on a subset of documents that meet the criteria defined by you at once.

## Creating and running a query within a review set

In order to create and run a query within your review set, click on "New Query" in your review set. After you name your query and define the conditions, click "Save" to run the query. To run a query that has been previously saved, simply click on the saved query. Refer to [Document metadata fields](document-metadata-fields.md) for a list of metadata you can search by.

## Building your query

You can build your query using a combination of condition cards and query language in the Keywords condition card. You can group condition cards together as a block to craft a more complex query.

### Condition card

Every searchable field in a review set has a corresponding condition card that you can use to build your query.

There are multiple types of condition cards:
- Freetext: freetext condition card is used for text fields such as subject. You can list multiple search terms by separating them out with a comma.
- Date: date condition card is used for date fields such as last modified date.
- Search options: search options condition card will provide a list of possible values for the particular field in your review set. This is used for fields, such as sender, where there is a finite number of possible values in your review set.
- Keyword: keyword condition card is a specific instance of freetext condition card that you can use to search for terms, or use KQL-like query language in. See below for more detail.

### Query language

In addition to condition cards, you can use a KQL-like query language in the Keywords card to craft your query. The query language supports standard KQL syntax like AND, OR, NOT, and NEAR(n). It also supports single-character wildcard (?) and multi-character wildcard (*).

## Filter

In addition to queries that you can save, you can overlay additional conditions on the fly to your query results using filters. Filters differ from queries in a few significant ways:
- Filters are transient (i.e. they do not persist over different sessions), whereas queries are saved to the review set.
- Filters are always additive; filters will apply on top of the query you have in effect at the moment, whereas applying a query will replace the query in effect.
