# Create organization-wide safe sender or blocked sender lists in Office 365
  
If you want to be sure that you receive mail from a particular sender, because you trust them and their messages, you can adjust your allow list in a spam filter policy in the Exchange admin center (EAC) at **Protection** \> **Spam filter**. Learn more about this at [Configure your spam filter policies](configure-your-spam-filter-policies.md). Another option would be create an Exchange mail flow rule (also known as a transport rule) that works like the domain or user-based allow list in the spam filter. You can block messages sent from a particular domain or user in a similar manner too.
  
A transport rule would be useful in this situation if you need to filter for complex criteria such as checking message headers or the names of attachments or if you want to add complex actions such as adding a disclaimer to the message or applying a time period where the rule is active. However, the preferred method to make sure emails from a specific sender or domain bypass your spam filter is to add them to your spam filter policy. Get started with this in the EAC by going to **Protection** \> **Spam filter**. Learn more at [Configure your spam filter policies](configure-your-spam-filter-policies.md).
  
> [!TIP]
> A domain-based list in a mail flow rule isn't as secure as an IP address-based list, because domains can be spoofed. Also, if the sending IP address is on a Block list, it will still be blocked even if filtering for the domain or user is being bypassed. This is because a mail flow rule on a domain or user does not override the global IP Block list. We recommend using an IP address-based list in most cases. To create an IP address-based list, you can use the IP Allow list or IP Block list in the connection filter. Any messages sent from these IP addresses aren't checked by the content filter. For instructions on how to configure the connection filter policy by adding IP addresses to the IP Allow list or IP Block list, see [Configure the connection filter policy](configure-the-connection-filter-policy.md). 
  
For additional management tasks related to mail flow rules, see [Mail flow rules (transport rules) in Exchange Online](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/743bd525-0ca2-426d-b76c-b4a052bc8886.aspx).
  
## Use the EAC to customize a block or allow list to prevent or receive email from a domain or user

1. In the EAC, go to **Protection** \> **Spam filter**. 
    
2. On the **general** page, do one of the following: 
    
  - Double-click the default policy or an existing policy in order to start editing it.
    
  - Click **New** in order to create a new custom spam-filter policy that can be applied to users, groups, and domains in your organization. 
    
3. On the **Allow Lists** page, you can specify entries, such as senders or domains, that will always be delivered to the inbox. Email from these entries is not processed by the spam filter. Do the following: 
    
  - Add trusted senders to the Sender allow list. Click **Add**, and then in the selection dialog box, add the sender addresses you wish to allow. You can separate multiple entries using a semi-colon or a new line. Click ok to return to the **Allow Lists** page. 
    
  - Add trusted domains to the Domain allow list. Click **Add**, and then in the selection dialog box, add the domains you wish to allow. You can separate multiple entries using a semi-colon or a new line. Click ok to return to the **Allow Lists** page. 
    
    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you allow top-level domains, it's likely that email you don't want will be delivered to an inbox. 
  
4. On the **Block Lists** page, you can specify entries, such as senders or domains, that will always be marked as spam. The service will apply the configured high confidence spam action on email that matches these entries. 
    
  - Add unwanted senders to the Sender block list. Click **Add**![Add Icon](media/ITPro-EAC-AddIcon.gif), and then in the selection dialog box, add the sender addresses you want to block. You can separate multiple entries using a semi-colon or a new line. Click **Ok** to return to the **Block Lists** page. 
    
  - Add unwanted domains to the Domain block list. Click **Add**![Add Icon](media/ITPro-EAC-AddIcon.gif), and then in the selection dialog box, add the domains you want to block. You can separate multiple entries using a semi-colon or a new line. Click **Ok** to return to the **Block Lists** page. 
    
    > [!CAUTION]
    > If you block top-level domains, it's likely that email you want will be marked as spam. 
  
## What do you need to know before you begin creating a mail flow rule?
    
- You don't need to create a mail flow rule to bypass spam filtering or mark email as spam for a sender or domain. Use the Exchange Online Protection block and allow lists in a spam policy instead of this mail flow rule if you simply want to block or allow a specific sender or domain and not attach any extra conditions. Learn more about this at [Configure your spam filter policies](configure-your-spam-filter-policies.md).
    
- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Mail flow rules" entry in the [Messaging policy and compliance permissions](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ec4d3b9f-b85a-4cb9-95f5-6fc149c3899b.aspx) topic.

## Use the EAC to create a mail flow rule to bypass spam filtering for a domain or user

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Mail flow** \> **Rules**. Choose **Add** ![Add Icon](media/ITPro-EAC-AddIcon.gif) and then choose **Bypass spam filtering**.
    
2. Give the rule a name. Under **Apply this rule if**, choose **The sender** and then select one of the following conditions: 
    
  - If you want to specify a domain, choose **domain is**. In the **Specify domain** dialog box, enter the domain of the sender you want to designate as safe, such as contoso.com. **Add** ![Add Icon](media/ITPro-EAC-AddIcon.gif) to move it to the list of phrases. Repeat this step if you want to add additional domains, and click **OK** when you are finished. 
    
  - If you want to specify a user, choose **is this person**. In the **Select members** dialog box, add the user from the list or type the user and click **Check names**. Repeat this step if you want to add additional users, and click **OK** when you are finished. 
    
3. Select the **Stop processing more rules** check box to ensure that no other rule can reverse the bypass action 
    
4. For the **Match sender address in message** option, select **Header or envelope**.
    
5. If you'd like, you can make selections to audit the rule, test the rule, activate the rule during a specific time period, and other selections.
    
6. Choose **Save** to save the rule. 
    
After you create and enforce the rule, spam filtering is bypassed for the domain or user you specified.
