# Prepare data for Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery

This topic describes how to load the results of a Content Search in to a case in Advanced eDiscovery. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> Advanced eDiscovery requires an Office 365 E3 with the Advanced Compliance add-on or an E5 subscription for your organization. If you don't have that plan and want to try Advanced eDiscovery, you can [sign up for a trial of Office 365 Enterprise E5](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=698279). 
  
## Step 1: Prepare Office 365 data for Advanced eDiscovery

To analyze data with Advanced eDiscovery, you can use the results of a Content Search that you run in the Microsoft 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center (listed on the **Content search** page in the Microsoft 365 Security &amp; Compliance Center) or a search associated with an eDiscovery case (listed on the **eDiscovery** page in the Security &amp; Compliance Center). 
  
For the detailed steps on preparing search results for analysis in Advanced eDiscovery, see [Prepare search results for Office 365 Advanced eDiscovery](prepare-search-results-for-advanced-ediscovery.md).
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you have data outside of Office 365 and want to import it to Office 365 so that you can prepare and analyze it in Advanced eDiscovery, a see [Overview of importing PST files to Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/ba688e0a-0fcb-4bd7-8e57-2b669564ea84) and [Archiving third-party data in Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=716918). 
  
## Step 2: Load search result data in to a case in Advanced eDiscovery

After you prepare the search results in the Security &amp; Compliance Center for analysis, the next step is to load the search results in to a case in Advanced eDiscovery. For more detailed information, see [Run the Process module](run-the-process-module-in-advanced-ediscovery.md).
  
1. Go to [https://protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com).
    
2. Sign in to Office 365 using your work or school account.
    
3. In the Security &amp; Compliance Center, click **Search &amp; investigation** \> **eDiscovery** to display the list of cases in your organization. 
    
4. Click **Open** next to the case that you want to load data in to in Advanced eDiscovery. 
    
5. On the **Home** page for the case, click **Advanced eDiscovery**. 
    
    ![Click Switch to Advanced eDiscovery to open the case in Advanced eDiscovery](media/8e34ba23-62e3-4e68-a530-b6ece39b54be.png)
  
    The **Connecting to Advanced eDiscovery** progress bar is displayed. When you're connected to Advanced eDiscovery, a list of containers is displayed on the setup page for the case. 
    
    ![The case is displayed in Advanced eDiscovery](media/8036e152-70dc-4bb7-9379-61c1ed8326b4.png)
  
     These containers represent the search results that you prepared for analysis in Advanced eDiscovery in Step 1. Note that the name of the container has the same name as the Content Search in the case in the Security &amp; Compliance Center. The containers in the list are the ones that you prepared. If a different user prepared search results for Advanced eDiscovery, the corresponding containers won't be included in the list. 
    
6. To load the search result data from a container in to the case in Advanced eDiscovery, select a container and then click **Process**.
    
After the search results from the Security &amp; Compliance Center are added to the case in Advanced eDiscovery, the next step is to use the tools in Advanced eDiscovery to analyze and cull the data that's relevant to the case.
